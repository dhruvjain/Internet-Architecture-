1.) To Create the topology for STP disabled, run the "topology_stp_disabled.sh" file using sh topology_stp_disabled.sh

2.) Similarly to create the toplogy for STP enabled, run "topology_stp_enabled.sh" file using sh topology_stp_enabled.sh

3.) Compile the udp server and client files using 

	* gcc client.c -o client
	* gcc server.c -o server

4.) Run the server on h2 by
	ip netns exec h2 ./server 

	Then enter the port no. say 1234

5.) Run the client on h1 by 
	ip netns exec h1 ./client 10.0.10.2 hello
	The enter the same port as entered in server side

6.) delete both of the toplogies using "sh delete_topology.sh"

The traces of corresponding scenerios are also attached: capture_sc1.pcapng for stp Disabled and capture_sc2.pcapng for stp Enabled
